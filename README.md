# Maze-Solver

This small project is a written in C programming language. In this project, I use depth first search to solve a maze and find a path. The program takes an input file as an argument. I will attach a simple txt file in the repositiory that can be run with the program. 

<p> To run the program, please follow the below steps </p>
<ul>
  <br> <li> Open the command line and navigate to the directory where the project is located</br> </li>
  <br> <li> type gcc maze.c </br></li>
  <br> <li> type ./a.out path1.txt, or if you want to run a different path file ./a.out path2.txt </br></li>
 </ul>
 
<p> Note, only path4.txt is the only file that does not contain a solution. Both the path1.txt and path2.txt have a solution. </p>
